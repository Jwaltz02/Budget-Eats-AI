# Budget-Eats-AI
Agentic AI price comparison assistant that scrapes restaurant menu pages from static HTML sites to find the cheapest meal + drink combo. Roadmap: support JS-heavy platforms (Uber Eats, DoorDash, SkipTheDishes) and simultaneously compare menus across the delivery apps for specific cravings (e.g. XL pizza).

# Current Capabilities
- Scrapes menu text from static restaurant websites
- Uses AI to identify main dishes, drinks, and prices
- Finds and returns the cheapest meal combination
- Takes in any user-provided restaurant link

# Coming Soon
Budget-Eats-AI is actively being expanded to support:
- JavaScript-heavy platforms like:
  * Uber Eats
  * DoorDash
  * SkipTheDishes
- Cross-platform comparison
- Finding the cheapest option for a specific craving (e.g., “XL pizza”) across all delivery apps

# Project Goal
To become a smart food-savings assistant that compares menus across all major delivery services and automatically finds the best possible deal for the user.
